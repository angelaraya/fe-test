# FE Demo App

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`. Project can be served locally with `npm start` and the test suite run with `npm test`.

# Notes

The project uses TailwindCSS as a CSS helper/utility except in the `Picker` component, which uses pure CSS as per the indications. All needed assets
are available in the `/public` directory or from Google Fonts API (via CSS' `import`).

Mobile support is included and works on most common smartphone resolutions as well as desktop displays.
